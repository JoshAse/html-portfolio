<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm someone who finds joy in both structure and spontaneity â€” from 
  coding a face recognition system to writing reflections 
  on identity and history. I value clarity, creativity, 
  and curiosity, and I love connecting ideas across fields 
  to build something useful or thought-provoking. If there'
  s a challenge, I'm the type to take it apart, understand
   it, and turn it into something better.</p>
